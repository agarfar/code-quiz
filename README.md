# Code Quiz

## Description

I designed an application to test user's coding knowledge using basic Javascript functions. The custom script allows users to save their score to local storage, and retake the quiz to attain a higher score. I learned how to use a combination of Javascript and CSS to edit, display, or remove HTML elements, as well as how to store and retrieve information from local storage.

## Usage

1. Access the application at the provided URL: https://agarfar.github.io/code-quiz/

2. Click Start to begin the quiz:

4. If the timer reaches zero or the user answers all questions, the quiz ends:
